## Elasticsearch Monitoring Tools

Elasticsearch is an API-based tool so there are no delivered GUI tools to monitor Elasticsearch. If you want a GUI to view the status of a cluster, node or indexes, you can use these tools: 

* [ElasticHQ](https://wiki.psadmin.io/posts/middleware/elastichq/)
* [Elasticsearch Head](https://mobz.github.io/elasticsearch-head/)
* [Cerebro](https://github.com/lmenezes/cerebro)
