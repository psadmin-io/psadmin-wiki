## Puppet Apply Powershell Function
With 8.56, the command line to run Puppet with the DPK got longer. You have to pass in the `--confdir` parameter and path every time you run Puppet.

To simplify the command, a simple Powershell function can be used to run the DPK. Add this function to your `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` file.

```powershell
function pa {
    $starttime = $(get-date)
    set-location c:\psft\dpk\puppet
    stop-service Psft*
    puppet apply .\manifests\production\site.pp --confdir=c:\psft\dpk\puppet --strict off -d
    $elapsedtime = $(get-date) - $starttime
    Write-Output "Run Time: ${elapsedtime}"
}
```

## Hiera Lookup Snippet
When doing a lot of Hiera lookups in your YAML files, it can be tedious to type out the `%{hiera('')}` string everytime. Here is a handy VSCode "snippet" for making this easier. If the YAML Language extension is installed [(redhat.vscode-yaml)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml), `lookup` will be able to autocomplete into the snippet, using `tab` to get inside, and then out of the hiera lookup. Add a new user snippet for the YAML file type with the following code:

```json
"lookup": {
    "prefix": "lookup",
    "body": ["\"%{hiera('$1')}\"$0"],
    "description": "Hiera Lookup Snippet"
 }
```
